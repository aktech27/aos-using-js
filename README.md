# Animate On Scroll

AOS - Animate on Scroll. This is a simple example to animate the elements of a webpage as the user scrolls through the page.

The AOS on this example is done mostly with vanilla JS, hence most of the values can be dynamic using data-\* markup. CSS is used only to style the element.
